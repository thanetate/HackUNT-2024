# HackUNT 2024 Halloween 

"Monster Match" – A spooky twist on traditional dating apps, this Tinder-like app connects ghouls, goblins, and all things monstrous with human or monster fans looking for a frightfully fun match. Swipe through profiles of eerie characters and see if sparks (or spooky chills) fly.


# The Challenge
Our team was presented with a unique challenge at a Halloween-themed hackathon to design a dating app tailored specifically for a supernatural audience. The goal was to creatively prototype an app that would capture the spirit of Halloween by connecting ghouls, goblins, and other monsters with potential matches.

This challenge tested both our technical and creative skills, requiring us to conceptualize a playful yet functional design that would stand out. We incorporated familiar dating app features but reimagined them with Halloween-themed elements, creating an engaging and entertaining experience for users. Through this process, we honed our abilities to think outside the box, collaborate efficiently under a tight 24hr deadline, and deliver a prototype that aligned with the hackathon’s goal of innovative, seasonal design.
